# aoc2022

This has my solutions to the Advent of Code Challenge in 2022.  No idea if I'll make it to the end (I haven't come close in previous years!)

Run via CLI:

```
usage: aoc2022.py [-h] [--debug] [--sub] [--all] day part

positional arguments:
  day         The Day we want to process
  part        Which part we're using

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --debug     Will create some extra output to add to the confusion. Will also run using the debug data instead of the user data
  --sub       Prints the sub
  --all       Runs all of the solutions! You still need to set the day and part, because I haven't worked out how to make these args optional
```
