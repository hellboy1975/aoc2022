# aoc2022

This has my solutions to the [Advent of Code Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/) in 2022.  No idea if I'll make it to the end (I haven't come close in previous years!)

Run via CLI:

```
usage: aoc2022.py [-h] [--debug] [--sub] [--all] day part

positional arguments:
  day         The Day we want to process
  part        Which part we're using

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --debug     Will create some extra output to add to the confusion. Will also run using the debug data instead of the user data
  --sub       Prints the sub
  --all       Runs all of the solutions! You still need to set the day and part, because I haven't worked out how to make these args optional
```
